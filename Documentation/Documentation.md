                        vote: Double,
                        (timestamp: Timestamp)
    }, ...],
    comments: [{

}



## Key-Value DB

Entities:
- Ingredient

Bucket Ingredients:

EntityName:Attribute=Value
    Ingredient:Calories=X

e.g.
    Pasta:Calories=100


## Graph DB

Entities:
- User:
    - (PK) == _id (PK of User in Document DB)
    - username [R]
  
- Recipe:
    - (PK) == _idPost (PK of Post in Document DB)
    - name [R]


- Ingredient:
    - (PK) == nameOfIngredient (PK of Ingredient in Key-Value DB)
    

Relationships:
- User --> :FOLLOWS --> User

- User --> :USED --> Ingredient
           (times: int) [R]
Here times keeps track of the fact that the relationship with the ingredient still exists in other recipes after the deletion of a recipe. If times = 0, even then the relationship can be deleted.

- Ingredient --> :USED_WITH --> Ingredient  
                 (times: int) [R]
[This relationship is bidirectional]

- Recipe --> :CONTAINS --> Ingredient

# Redundancies


Where is the Redundancy | Reason | Original Value
-----------------------|--------|----------------

User{
    posts: [{
                name,
                image
    }]
}
Reason: to avoid joins 
Oringinal Value: Post{
                       recipe:{
                                name,
                                image
                       }
                     }

--- 

Post{
    username
}
Reason: to avoid joins
Original Value: User{
                        username
                    }

---

Post{
    recipe:{
                totalCalories
           }
}
Reason: to avoid computing the total calories of a recipe every time that a post is shown
Original Value: It is possibile to compute the total calories of a recipe by summing the calories of each ingredient of the recipe  (retrieving the calories of each ingredient from the Key-Value DB)

---

Post{
    avgStarRanking
}
Reason: to avoid computing the average star ranking of a post every time that a post is shown
Original Value: It is possibile to compute the average star ranking of a post by summing the star rankings of each user and dividing by the number of users that voted for the post

---

Post{
    starRankings: [{
                        username,
    }]
}
Reason: to avoid joins
Original Value: User{
                        username
                    }

---

Post{
    comments: [{
                    username,
    }]
}
Reason: to avoid joins
Original Value: User{
                        username
                    }

---

GraphDB: The redundancies inside the GraphDB are necessary to avoid joins with the DocumentDB. In this way we can show partial information.

User:
    - username
Reason: to avoid joins with the DocumentDB
Original Value: User{
                        username
                    }

---

Recipe:
    - name

Reason: to avoid joins with the DocumentDB
Original Value: Post{
                        recipe:{
                                    name
                               }
                    }

---

:USED:
    - times

Reason: to avoid computing the number of times that an ingredient is used every time that is needed.
Original Value: it is possible to compute the number of times that an ingredient is used by counting the number of times that a user has used an ingredient in his/her recipes (retrieving the information from the DocumentDB).

---

:USED_WITH:
    - times

Reason: to avoid computing the number of times that an ingredient is used with another ingredient every time that is needed.
Original Value: it is possible to compute the number of times that an ingredient is used with another ingredient by counting the number of times that a user has used an ingredient with another ingredient in his/her recipes (retrieving the information from the DocumentDB).
